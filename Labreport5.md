### Part 2: Reflection

Vim was a brand new thing for me to grasp. Although it’s not the most intuitive and my fingers are playing Twister on the keyboard half the time, I really enjoy it. 
I personally feel quite cool not having to use a mouse, and I really like learning new shortcuts; my current favorite vim shortcut is <line #> + <shift> + <g> to go to a specific line, but my forever favorite is <tab> on the command line as I love not having to type everything on the command line.
